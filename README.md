# Hippopotomonstrosesquipedalian
Welcome to the repository! To get started, download the Python script so you can run your Hippopotomonstrosesquipedalian scripts.
## How to use
There are only two words you can use:
* hippopotomonstrosesquipedalian, which represents a `0`
* pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis, which represents a `1`
The words are decoded to the number they represent, then the binary string is decoded using the ASCII character set. This new string is run as a Python programme.
### How to run
You first need to run the Python script (this is the compiler). After, you need to type in the file path to the script you want to run. It will run.
#### Residual file

Please note that there will be a Python script created called `programme_made_by_compiler_do_not_touch.py`. If the compiler isn't running, you can delete it.
### Required file extension
You can use any file extension you want for the script, but it has to be written using a plain text editor (so no MS Word).
